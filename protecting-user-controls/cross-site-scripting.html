<!--
ACTIVITY: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

WHAT THIS ACTIVITY IS ABOUT:
This activity shows how a website can accidentally run code that a user types in.

Normally, user input should be treated as plain text.
If the browser treats it as HTML, it may execute scripts.

This is called Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

WHAT YOU WILL DO:
You will see how unsafe code works,
then make one small change to stop the attack.

<input id="nameInput" placeholder="Enter your name">
<button onclick="showName()">Submit</button>

<div id="output"></div>

<script>
function showName() {

    // STEP 1:
    // Get the text that the user typed into the input box.
    // IMPORTANT: The browser does NOT know if this text is safe.
    const name = document.getElementById("nameInput").value;

    // STEP 2:
    // Find the <div> with the id "output".
    // The property 'innerHTML' tells the browser:
    // "Treat this string as REAL HTML".
    //
    // This is dangerous when the text comes from a user,
    // because HTML can contain JavaScript.
    //
    // TRY THIS INPUT:
    // <img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">
    //
    // QUESTION:
    // Why does the alert run?
    document.getElementById("output").textContent =
        "Welcome, " + name;

    // STEP 3 (YOUR TASK):
    // Change innerHTML to textContent.
    //
    // textContent tells the browser:
    // "Treat this ONLY as text, not HTML".
    //
    // This stops the browser from running scripts.
}
</script>
